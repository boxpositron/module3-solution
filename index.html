We could buy your soul from the gods.” Thren had fought down his initial impulse to bury a shortsword in the fat man’s throat. A terrible mistake in hindsight. They had met inside his extravagant mansion, another mistake. Thren vowed to correct his carelessness in the coming months. He had tried to stop the war from erupting, but it appeared everyone in Veldaren desired chaos. If the city wants blood, it can have it, Thren thought. But it won’t be mine. “Are you in here, father?” he heard his elder son ask from an adjacent room. Thren held his anger in check. “And if I was not?” he asked. His son Randith entered from the other room. He looked much like his father, having the same sharp features, thin nose, and grim smile.
